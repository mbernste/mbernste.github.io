_I am currently reading Sun Tzu's Art of War and, as cliche as it sounds, am finding much wisdom in it. I have been taking notes during my reading and I thought I'd share them in this post. Here I cover Books 1 and 2._

Introduction
------------

I am currently reading Sun Tzu's [_Art of War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War) and I am finding much wisdom in it. I have been taking notes during my reading and I thought I'd share them in this post. 

As a brief background, _The Art of War_ is a treatis on military conflict and strategic assessment written by a Chinese general somewhere around 500 B.C. It is an enduring text because the wisdom that it contains generalizes far beyond military conflict. A small sample of the themes in the book include treating conflict as a scientific discipline, strategic advantage through information, and the principles of good leadership. 

In this post, I'll cover the second two "chapters" of the book. I'll write Sun Tzu's original text in bold (as translated by Thomas Cleary). My commentary on each point will follow.

Book 3: Planning a Siege
------------------------

**The general rule for use of the military is that it is better to keep a nation intact than to destroy it. It is better to keep an army intact than to destroy it, better to keep a division intact than to destroy it, better to keep a battalion intact than to destroy it, better to keep a unit intact than to destroy it.**

* Sun Tzu lays out a fundamental principal: Avoid destruction. Not only is this an ethical and moral principal, but a strategically advantageous one as well. 

**If you can keep the opponent’s nation intact, then your own nation will also be intact. So this is best.**

* Destruction requires the expenditure of energy and will weaken one's self. Destruction will evoke a violent and commensurate response from one's enemy and thus incurs risk. Destruction also seeds an enemy's anger and may galvanize the enemy.

**This means that killing is not the important thing.**

* In a conflict, the most important thing is the outcome, not necessarily the means by which that outcome is achieved. The act of killing, and destruction more generally, is  an extreme and consequential act; it should be treated with the utmost respect.

**Therefore those who win every battle are not really skillful—those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all.**

* A core theme of the book is stated explicitly here: Dominance is achieved before a conflict begins. In fact, utter dominance usually leads to an avoidance of direct conflict altogether.

**Therefore the superior militarist strikes while schemes are being laid.**

* I see two ways to interpret this point: The first interpretation is that one should strike first and quickly when your opponent least expects it (i.e. during the planning stage of a conflict); however, this seems to contradict the prior point that "those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all". Thus, a second interpretation that is more consistent with the prior point is that victory itself is achieved through superior preparation and scheming -- Winning by rendering your opponent helpless and unable to fight before they were aware of what you were up to.  

**The next best is to attack alliances.**

* If victory cannot be achieved through superior scheming, then the next best path to victory is to disrupt the opponent's alliances, or more generally, their support system.
* This strategy is inferior to winning through scheming (i.e. the prior point) because it risks revealing information. This runs counter to Sun Tzu's teachings throughout the book in which he emphasizes the importance of keeping ones cards close to the chest. The act of disrupting alliances is at outward, active act that may reveal portions of ones strategy.

**The next best is to attach the army.**

* I interpret this to mean "direct conflict".
* One should only engage in direct conflict only when the prior strategies cannot be executed on (maneuvering, scheming, and disrupting the opponent's support system).
* The fact that direct conflict is ranked as only the third best strategy emphasizes the earlier point that, "Those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all."

**The lowest is to attack a city. Siege of a city is only done as a last resort.**
