_I am currently reading Sun Tzu's Art of War and, as cliche as it sounds, am finding much wisdom in it. I have been taking notes during my reading and I thought I'd share them in this post. Here I cover Books 1 and 2._

Introduction
------------

I am currently reading Sun Tzu's [_Art of War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War) and I am finding much wisdom in it. I have been taking notes during my reading and I thought I'd share them in this post. 

As a brief background, _The Art of War_ is a treatis on military conflict and strategic assessment written by a Chinese general somewhere around 500 B.C. It is an enduring text because the wisdom that it contains generalizes far beyond military conflict. A small sample of the themes in the book include treating conflict as a scientific discipline, strategic advantage through information, and the principles of good leadership. 

In this post, I'll cover the second two "chapters" of the book. I'll write Sun Tzu's original text in bold (as translated by Thomas Cleary). My commentary on each point will follow.

Book 3: Planning a Siege
------------------------

**The general rule for use of the military is that it is better to keep a nation intact than to destroy it. It is better to keep an army intact than to destroy it, better to keep a division intact than to destroy it, better to keep a battalion intact than to destroy it, better to keep a unit intact than to destroy it.**
