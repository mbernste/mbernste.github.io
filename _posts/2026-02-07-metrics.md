_THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

# Introduction

The practice of using data to rationally guide our decisions and draw conclusions has arguably been the driving force that has brought human civilization from a subsistance existance to one characterized by comfort and abundance (relatively speaking!). For good reason, the importance of data-driven reasoning has been deeply instilled into the culture quantiative and technical disciplines. Concurrently, the systems that we both build and operate within are too complex to fit, in their entirety, within our meager human minds. For example, gross domestic product (GDP)  is a metric that summarizes overall productivity in an economy (a highly complex system). The body mass index (BMI) is a (arguably flawed) metric for tracking overall body composition.

The combination of both our secular cultural traditions and the simple need to understand complex systems lead technical organizations to fixate on **metrics** (a metric defined here to simply be a measured quantity tracked over time). This reliance on metrics is deeply ingrained. Managers repeat quotes like, "You can't manage what you can't measure." Software engineers create dashboards and databases to track metrics. Meetings often begin with an overview of where the project at hand stands in terms of the metrics.

I would not be the first one to point out that an over-reliance on metrics can lead to poor outcomes. [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) is an adage attributed to the economist, [Charles Goodhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodhart), that goes, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) did well in articulating the process by which a metric "ceases to be a good measure." In a [recent podcast interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ij964FCQiw), Bezos describes how organizations can target things like metrics as a _proxy_ for the thing the organization _actually_ cares about and then, over time, that proxy becomes a poor approximation for that true thing:

*One of the things that happens in business is that you develop certain things that you’re managing to. The typical case would be a metric. And that metric isn’t the typical underlying thing. Maybe the metric is something like the number of returns you get per unit sold… And so what happens is a little bit of a kind of inertia sets in where somebody a long time ago invented that metric… and they had a reason why they chose that metric. And then fast forward five years and that metric becomes the proxy for truth… Let’s say that metric is a proxy for customer happiness. That metric is not actually customer happiness; it’s a proxy for customer happiness. The person who invented the metric understood that connection. Five years later… you forget the truth behind why you were watching that metric in the first place. And then the world shifts a little bit. And now that proxy isn’t as valuable as it used to be. Or it’s missing something.*

In this blog post, I would like to delve a bit deeper into the ways in which metrics can be used and misused by technical organizations. To do so, I will develop a sort of quasi-mathematical framework for thinking about metrics that has provided me a helpful mental model. To spoil the punchline, I will frame a system as a complex [high-dimensional](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/intrinsic_dimensionality/) object -- the system might be a business, service, process, or technology. A metric is then a projection of that high-dimensional system onto the real number line. Metrics can then be categorized by the properties of that function and we can reason about what makes some metrics more prone to misues than others. Let's get started.

## Systems as high-dimensional objects

Before we get to discussing metrics, we will first generalize the system being measured as a [high-dimensional](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/intrinsic_dimensionality/), or more simply, as a high-dimensional [vector](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/vector_spaces/). By "system", I mean any complicated thing that a given technical organization seeks to understand or improve. Such systems might be businesses (with all of the complexities they entail), processes (such as biological or ecological systems), or technologies (including both physical hardware and algorithms).

## Value functions

## Metrics as functions that "project" systems into lower dimensions

## Categorizing metrics

### Exploratory metrics

### Value-measuring metrics

## Not all systems admit an accurate value-measuring metric
