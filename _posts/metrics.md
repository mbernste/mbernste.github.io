The practice of using data to rationally guide our decisions and draw objective conclusions about the world has arguably been the driving force that has brought human civilization from a subsistance existance to one characterized by comfort and abundance (relatively speaking!). For good reason, the importance of data-driven reasoning has been deeply instilled into the culture of those us working in quantiative and technical disciplines. Concurrently, the systems that we both build and operate within are too complex to fit, in their entirety, within our meager human minds. For example, gross domestic product (GDP)  is a metric that summarizes overall productivity in an economy (a highly complex system). The body mass index (BMI) is a (arguably flawed) metric for tracking overall body composition.

The combination of both our secular cultural traditions and the simple need to understand complex systems lead technical organizations to fixate on **metrics**. The reliance on metrics is deeply ingrained. Quotes like, "You can't manage what you can't measure", are passed around organizations as a mantra.  


For the purpose of this blog post, I will define a **metric** to simply be a feature of a system that is measured and tracked over time.



For those of us who do technical or quantitative work (whether that be in business, science, or engineering) it has no doubt been instilled deep within our bones the importance of using data to rationally guide our decisions and conclusions we draw about the world. This cultural tradition, to exalt data, has been passed down to us 


The Enlightenment brought to the world the importance of reasoning about the objective nature of reality and using data to rationality, 


For those of us who do technical work in this modern age of enlightenment and scientific progress, it has been instilled that 

Indeed, this practice is a torch that has been passed down through generations of mentors and forebears, reaching back to the Age of Reason.
