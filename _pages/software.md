Here are some of the software products to come out of my research:

### Monkeybread

Explore cellular niches in single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics data.

* GitHub: [https://github.com/immunitastx/monkeybread](https://github.com/immunitastx/monkeybread)  
* Documentation: [https://monkeybread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://monkeybread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  

### SpatialCorr

Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable both the measurement of genome-wide gene expression profiles and their mapping to spatial locations within a tissue. SpatialCorr is a method for identifying sets of genes with spatially varying correlation structure. Given a collection of gene sets pre-defined by a user, SpatialCorr tests for spatially induced differences in the correlation of each gene set within tissue regions, as well as between and among regions.
