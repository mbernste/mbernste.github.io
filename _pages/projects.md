Here are some of the software products to come out of my research:

### Monkeybread

Explore cellular niches in single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics data.

* GitHub: [https://github.com/immunitastx/monkeybread](https://github.com/immunitastx/monkeybread)  
* Documentation: [https://monkeybread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://monkeybread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  

### SpatialCorr

Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable both the measurement of genome-wide gene expression profiles and their mapping to spatial locations within a tissue. SpatialCorr is a method for identifying sets of genes with spatially varying correlation structure. Given a collection of gene sets pre-defined by a user, SpatialCorr tests for spatially induced differences in the correlation of each gene set within tissue regions, as well as between and among regions.

### CellO

Cell type annotation is a fundamental task in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We present [CellO](https://github.com/deweylab/CellO), a machine learning-based tool for annotating human RNA-seq data with the [Cell Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html). CellO enables accurate and standardized cell type classification by considering the rich hierarchical structure of known cell types. Furthemore, CellO comes pre-trained on a novel, comprehensive dataset of human, healthy, untreated primary samples in the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (SRA) which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most diverse curated collection of primary cell data to date.
