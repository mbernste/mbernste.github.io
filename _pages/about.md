I am a computational scientist excited by the challenge of transforming the world's vast and growing collections of high-dimensional genomics data into insights that drive progress in human health.

Currently, I am Principal Computational Scientist at [Somite AI](https://www.somite.ai) where I develop computational approaches for deciphering cell signaling patterns that control cell differentiation in development.

Prior to Somite, I was Staff Scientist, Machine Learning at [Stellaromics](https://www.stellaromics.com) where I developed computational and machine learning approaches for converting raw, terabyte-scale bio-imaging data into spatial gene expression information. In addition, I developed deep generative machine learning models that simulated raw imaging data that we used to test and benchmark our computational methods.

Prior to that, I was Principal Scientist at [Immunitas Therapeutics](https://www.immunitastx.com) where I built a computational platform for identifying novel drug targets in immuno-oncology. I also implemented computational strategies for identifying clinical biomarkers of drug efficacy emerging from the company's phase 1 clinical trial of IMT-009, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor.
